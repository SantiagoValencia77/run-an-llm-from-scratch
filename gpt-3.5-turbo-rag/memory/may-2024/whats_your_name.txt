 Every year since her mom passed, Sarah has commemorated her mom's birthday in a special way. She calls that day – March 19 – "Ruthie Day." "I always ask everyone to do one random, selﬂess act of kindness, just like my mom did every day," she said. "Like she always said, we never know what each person is going through."And now that she's cleaned up her lifestyle, Sarah hopes to enjoy many more Ruthie Days. "I want to see my friends and families grow up and see their children grow up," she said. "I want to do and see as much as I can on this beautiful earth for as long as I can. I know all too well that I only have one life, and I want to take care of it."
