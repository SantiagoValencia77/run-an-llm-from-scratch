    "* **Retrieval detailed** - Find relevant information given a query e.b (we'll build Nutri-chat) a model that reads and trains it's neural network with those 1200 pages in the textbook about nutrution, so those model will serve as more a guide on what it learned from the data recieved on textbook, to provide relevant information on that subject. By giving a set of question that the model can respond if we train it to on general dialogue. (what are the macronutrients and what do they) \n",
    "* **Retrieval** - Find relevant info given a query (input data), e.g. \"what are the macronutrients and what do they do>\" -> retrieves passages of text related to the macronutrients from a nutrition textbook. (goes to layer it retrieved from all and matches strings with the number it encoded and relations on those text)\n",
    "* **Augmented** - We want to take the relevant information and augment our input (prompt) \"make of greater importantance and match with the best relating text pattern output and bring it to an LLM with that relevant information.\n",
    "* **Generation detailed** - Take the first two steps R (retrieve input and text data relating towards input) and A (increase the importance of input with the relevant and most matched data retrieved making it augment the whole data) and pass them to an LLM for generative outputs. (to match the whole data importance to say in feedback this certain mode create \"asko\" the quotes are the augmentation if did from retrieving and pattern matching to input and the model from trained on dialogue to say proper general feedback to give this is this or that and know how to respond to question and understand mostly what's being typed completely)\n",

    "What was said: *\"This work offers several positive societal benefits over previous work: the fact that it is more strongly grounded in real factual knowledge (in this case Wikipedia) makes it “hallucinate” less with generations that are more factual, and offers more control and interpretability. RAG could be employed in a wide variety of scenarios with direct benefit to society, for example by endowing it with a medical index and asking it open-domain questions on that topic, or by helping people be more effective at their jobs. With these advantages also come potential downsides: Wikipedia, or any potential external knowledge source, will probably never be entirely factual and completely devoid of bias. Since RAG can be employed as a language model, similar concerns as for GPT-2 [50] are valid here, although arguably to a lesser extent, including that it might be used to generate abuse, faked or misleading content in the news or on social media; to impersonate others; or to automate the production of spam/phishing content [54]. Advanced language models may also lead to the automation of various jobs in the coming decades [16]. In order to mitigate these risks, AI systems could be employed to fight against misleading content and automated spam/phishing.\"*"

    "#### Why Rag\n",
    "\n",
    "The main goal of Rag is to improve the generation of outputs of LLMs.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Prevent hallucinations - LLMs are incredibly good at generating good *looking* text, however, this text doesn't mean it's factual. Rage can help LLMs generate information based on relevant passages that are factual. (information stored somewhere to view what it sees by complete to know what your saying, GPT grabs bits and pieces what it sees and can't get you a straight answer to what you see)\n",
    "\n",
    "Give specific topics to answer and if needing to bounce around on different topics match you can have GPT mix what your trying to understand in a RAG model\n",
    "\n",
    "(GPT) can be very generic when asking questions like do this than this or this and those can help, but it doesn't tell you on things that can be a better solution to a deeper topic on understanding what it knows which is RAG can do to ask those questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Word with custom data - Many base LLMs are trained with internet-scale data. This means they have a fairly good understanding of language in general. ( they read internet data) which is filled with human text of conversations, behaviours, types of way of asking questions and answering\n",
    "\n",
    "Augmentation would be to take passages from documents that you stored, put them into the query that's being asked. Than have a generative LLM to take those documents it has stored and retrieved from training data and stored data and format back to what it saw in a readable informative way for the user on query. This is the main point with **RAG**, it helps create specific responses based on specific documents"

Women undergoing mastectomy who elect breast reconstruction have several options, including the type of tissue or implant used to restore breast shape. Reconstruction may be performed at the time of mastectomy or later, but often requires more than one surgery. Depending on cancer stage, subtype, and sometimes other test results, such as tumor gene expression profiling (e.g., Oncotype DX), treatment may also involve chemotherapy (before and/or after surgery), hormone (anti-estrogen) therapy, targeted therapy, and/ or immunotherapy (e.g., immune checkpoint inhibitors). Survival: The 5- and 10-year relative survival rates are 91% and 85%, respectively, for invasive breast cancer overall, mostly because two-thirds of women are diagnosed with localized-stage disease. Despite progress over time, the 5-year survival rate is 10% lower (in absolute terms) for Black women (83%) than for White women (93%; Table 7), partly reflecting lower likelihood of localized-stage diagnosis (56% versus 67%). Reducing this and other cancer disparities is a focus of the American Cancer Society and many other organizations.

These molecules act as brakes on the immune system, preventing it from attacking normal cells. By blocking these checkpoints, checkpoint inhibitors can \"release the brakes\" on the immune system, allowing it to recognize and attack cancer cells, weakening them. 2. Targeted Therapies: Targeted therapies are drugs that target speciﬁc molecules or pathways that are critical for cancer cell growth and survival. For example, tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) target enzymes called tyrosine kinases, which are involved in cell signaling pathways that promote cancer growth. By inhibiting these enzymes, targeted therapies can weaken cancer cells. 3. Apoptosis Inducers: Apoptosis is a process of programmed cell death that eliminates damaged or abnormal cells.',\n",

    "    Query: What are the fat-soluble vitamins?\n",
    "    Answer: The fat-soluble vitamins include Vitamin A, Vitamin D, Vitamin E, and Vitamin K. These vitamins are absorbed along with fats in the diet and can be stored in the body's fatty tissue and liver for later use. Vitamin A is important for vision, immune function, and skin health. Vitamin D plays a critical role in calcium absorption and bone health. Vitamin E acts as an antioxidant, protecting cells from damage. Vitamin K is essential for blood clotting and bone metabolism.\n",
    "    \\nExample 2:\n",
    "    Query: What are the causes of type 2 diabetes?\n",
    "    Answer: Type 2 diabetes is often associated with overnutrition, particularly the overconsumption of calories leading to obesity. Factors include a diet high in refined sugars and saturated fats, which can lead to insulin resistance, a condition where the body's cells do not respond effectively to insulin. Over time, the pancreas cannot produce enough insulin to manage blood sugar levels, resulting in type 2 diabetes. Additionally, excessive caloric intake without sufficient physical activity exacerbates the risk by promoting weight gain and fat accumulation, particularly around the abdomen, further contributing to insulin resistance.\n",
    "    \\nExample 3:\n",
    "    Query: What is the importance of hydration for physical performance?\n",
    "    Answer: Hydration is crucial for physical performance because water plays key roles in maintaining blood volume, regulating body temperature, and ensuring the transport of nutrients and oxygen to cells. Adequate hydration is essential for optimal muscle function, endurance, and recovery. Dehydration can lead to decreased performance, fatigue, and increased risk of heat-related illnesses, such as heat stroke. Drinking sufficient water before, during, and after exercise helps ensure peak physical performance and recovery.\n",
