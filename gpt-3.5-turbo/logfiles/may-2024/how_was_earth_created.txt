User query: how was earth created
Answer:

Output:

The Earth was formed approximately 4.5 billion years ago through a process called accretion. This involved particles in the early solar system coming together due to gravity, eventually forming the planet we now call home. The early Earth was a hot and violent place, with volcanic activity and frequent impacts from asteroids and comets shaping its surface.

If you're interested in learning more about the formation of Earth, I recommend exploring resources from reputable scientific sources such as NASA or the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History. These sources can provide detailed information and visuals to help you better understand the fascinating process of Earth's creation.
