## Run An Gen-LLM From Scratch
Today I'll show you how to run several open source Generative LLM using Python, We'll look at a view concepts, than just pure code. If you want to do the same thing did, you can feel free to follow the steps I'll show ðŸ˜Š.
One other thing, if you need the files I used to make this project, look at this github repo for more context and info for this: https://github.com/SantiagoValencia77/run-an-llm-from-scratch/tree/main

Let's start!


There are several ways you can run this, on jupyter notebook or on visual studio code, it's really up too you. I'm just going to stick to VS Code (Visual Studio Code) as tradition. A really good advice I can give for deep learning workspaces is to stick close to the Linux environment because nvidia configuration works really smoothly on Linux compared to windows, so to avoid hassle in the future, I recommend to you that if you already have Linux as your OS, well your setup. If you have windows, no worries, we can install WSL 2 on your OS to work as a bridge to Linux distribution such as Ubuntu.


If you are using windows follow the steps i'll show. Otherwise just ignore this and skip too (predefined skip):

> To install WSL2, follow this link instructions: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install
I can't tell were in the future you will see this so the steps may change which is why the best way is to look at the document from Microsoft themselves.

After you have downloaded WSL2
