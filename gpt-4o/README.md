### GPT-4o

This project is very similiar to `gpt-3.5-turbo`, just re-use what you did there into here, your just going to have change a bit the API request dialogue prompt when calling the gpt-4o, instead of gpt-3.5-turbo change it to gpt-4o

I recommend to also, try to play around with openai models, use the vision, audio together and see what you can make, nothing better than to challenge yourself more, you can build experience a lot of people don't have!

View my documentation on the gpt-3.5-turbo-rag folder again if you need help with this setup since it's very similiar.
