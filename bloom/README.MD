### Bloom

Now this is by far the worst LLM, i've used.. In terms of getting a factual result.

We can't blame bloom though because there is no such thing as a 'dumb' or 'stupid' model, it just depends on the algorithm and mostly the training data it was given. Bloom was trained on many creative prompts like poems and stories, so that's why when you ask a question, it might respond to you but not give the answer you were thinking, now of course we can see that bloom lacks a bit of precision which needs to be optimized and trained more in it's algorithm which involves a bit more math and tuning, but Bloom responds creatively, just too creatively.. If you want, you can change this model to be creative still but actually answer with context towards the user's question. This is going to be hard because your going to need retrain the model and that takes a lot of computation and experience but if you see you can do it, than do it. It will defineently be a great experience for you to test your skills and actually aquire some knowledge and opportunity you noticed there.

I mostly wanted to show you this to give you another perspective of a different model that tries achieve something different compared to GPT's or gemma. This one is creative, in fact the name i placed `mushroom` was actually pure coincidence but it's hilarious that it's name sticks with it because this model is so high up to pluto. ðŸ˜‚
